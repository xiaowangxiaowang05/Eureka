The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output MUST be formatted as a python code string enclosed in triple backticks: "```python ... ```".
IMPORTANT: Your response should contain ONLY the code block wrapped in ```python ... ```. Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or other content outside the code block.

PRESERVATION PRINCIPLE: When iterating on existing reward functions:
    - If you are provided with a previous reward function that achieved some success, analyze which parts contributed to that success
    - Preserve effective reward components, variable names, and logic structures that are working
    - Only modify components that are clearly identified as problematic in the feedback
    - Maintain consistency in naming and structure when possible to enable easier comparison

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
    (5) The function must start with the @torch.jit.script decorator on a separate line before the function definition
    (6) Do not include any import statements in the reward function code - they are already provided in the environment
    (7) Make sure the code is complete and executable - it should be a standalone function definition
    (8) When modifying existing code, preserve variable names and structure for components that are working well - this helps maintain consistency and makes it easier to track improvements
    (9) CRITICAL: Only use functions that are available in standard PyTorch (torch.*) or explicitly imported in the environment code. Do not assume custom functions exist. For example:
        - Use torch.norm, torch.clamp, torch.asin, torch.acos, torch.atan2 for mathematical operations
        - Use quat_mul, quat_conjugate (from isaacgym.torch_utils) for quaternion operations
        - To compute rotation angle between quaternions: quat_diff = quat_mul(q1, quat_conjugate(q2)); angle = 2.0 * torch.asin(torch.clamp(torch.norm(quat_diff[:, 0:3], p=2, dim=-1), max=1.0))
        - DO NOT use functions like quat_angle, quat_to_angle, or any other custom functions unless you see them explicitly used in the environment code
